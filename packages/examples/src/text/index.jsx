            In spring the river rises as high as the sea, And with the river's
            rise the moon uprises bright. She follows the rolling waves for ten
            thousand li, And where the river flows, there overflows her light.
            The river winds around the fragrant islet where The blooming flowers
            in her light all look like snow. You cannot tell her beams from hoar
            frost in the air, Nor from white sand upon Farewell Beach below. No
            dust has stained the water blending with the skies; A lonely
            wheellike moon shines brilliant far and wide. Who by the riverside
            first saw the moon arise? When did the moon first see a man by
            riverside? Ah, generations have come and past away;A Moonlit Night
            on the Spring River From year to year the moons look alike, old and
            new. We do not know tonight for whom she sheds her ray, But hear the
            river say to its water adieu. Away, away is sailing a single cloud
            white; On Farewell Beach pine away maples green. Where is the
            wanderer sailing his boat tonight? Who, pining away, on the moonlit
            rails would learn? Alas! The moon is lingering over the tower; It
            should have seen the dressing table of the fair. She rolls the
            curtain up and light comes in her bower; She washes but can't wash
            away the moonbeams there. She sees the moon, but her beloved is out
            of sight; She'd follow it to shine on her beloved one's face. But
            message-bearing swans can't fly out of moonlight, Nor can
            letter-sending fish leap out of their place. Last night he dreamed
            that falling flowers would not stay. Alas! He can't go home,
            although half spring has gone. The running water bearing spring will
            pass away; The moon declining over the pool will sink anon. The moon
            declining sinks into a heavy mist; It's a long way between southern
            rivers and eastern seas. How many can go home by moonlight who are
            missed? The sinking moon sheds yearning o'er riverside trees. In
            spring the river rises as high as the sea, And with the river's rise
            the moon uprises bright. She follows the rolling waves for ten
            thousand li, And where the river flows, there overflows her light.
